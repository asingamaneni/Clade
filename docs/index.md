features:
  - title: Multi-Agent Orchestration
    details: Create specialized agents — coding, research, ops, PM — each with their own personality, memory, and tools.
  - title: Proactive, Not Reactive
    details: Agents wake up on a configurable heartbeat, check for issues, and act before you ask. They observe, anticipate, and report.
  - title: Multi-Channel
    details: Talk to your agents via Slack, Telegram, Discord, or the built-in web chat. Use @mentions to address specific agents.
  - title: Persistent Memory
    details: Two-layer memory system — daily logs and curated knowledge — with full-text search. Agents remember everything.
  - title: Autonomous Work (RALPH)
    details: Give an agent a task list. It works through each task, verifies its work, and reports back. Works for any domain.
  - title: Self-Improving
    details: Agents reflect on interactions and evolve their SOUL.md personality over time. Core principles stay locked.
  - title: Agent Portability
    details: Export agents as portable bundles and import them on another machine. Identity, memory, and config travel together.
  - title: Native Platform Integration
    details: Agents can send system notifications, read your clipboard, open URLs, and take screenshots out of the box.
  - title: MCP Servers
    details: Standard MCP servers — no proprietary format. Discover MCP servers from npm, or agents can create their own (with approval).
